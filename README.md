# LUdecomposition
This repository contains LU decomposition of different size of matrices and their results using sequential, threaded and open MP. It also shows the comparison of time taken by different size of matrices and different methods. 
Use "./project.sh" command in command prompt to compile c++ files, run all the 3 c++ files of sequential, threaded and openMP implementations and write required output in respective txt files.
Use "make splot" command to plot the graph for sequential implementation of LU decomposition.
Use "make tplot" and "make oplot" for threaded and openMP implementations respectively.
